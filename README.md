# Router1X3
This project implements a 1x3 Router designed in Verilog and verified using SystemVerilog with UVM (Universal Verification Methodology). The router is capable of directing data from a single input channel to one of three output channels based on the control signals.

# Key Features
- Supports 1 input and 3 output channels.

- Efficient data routing based on control signals.

- Designed using Verilog for RTL (Register Transfer Level) implementation.

- Comprehensive verification using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).

- Achieved 98% functional coverage and 100% coverage using Assertion-Based Verification (SVA).
